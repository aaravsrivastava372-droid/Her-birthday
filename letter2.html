<h1>For Akshara 💗</h1>

<p>Happy 16th Birthday, Akshara.</p>

<p>
I don’t even know where to start because there’s honestly so much I want to say.
But today is about reminding you how special you truly are.
</p>

<p>
You are one of those rare people who make everything around them feel lighter.
The way you care, the way you stay, the way you understand people — it all makes you different.
</p>

<p>
I hope this year gives you everything you’ve been wishing for.
I hope you achieve every goal you’re working toward.
I hope you make your parents proud, yourself proud, and build the life you dream about.
</p>

<p>
You deserve happiness that stays.
You deserve friendships that last.
You deserve success that feels beautiful and real.
</p>

<p>
Never doubt yourself, Akshara.
You are stronger than you think and kinder than most people.
And honestly, the world becomes better with people like you in it.
</p>

<p>
May this year bring new memories, new achievements and moments that stay with you forever.
</p>

<p>
Happy Birthday once again.
I truly wish the best for you — always.
</p>

<p>— From someone who genuinely cares ✨</p>
