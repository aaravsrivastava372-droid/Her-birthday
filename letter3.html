<h1>One Last Letter 🌙</h1>

<p>Happy Birthday, Akshara.</p>

<p>
If you’re reading this, it means you opened the last envelope.
And this is the letter where I say what matters the most.
</p>

<p>
Out of everyone in this huge world,
I’m really glad our paths crossed.
</p>

<p>
You’ve become someone whose presence genuinely changes my day.
Someone who makes ordinary moments feel memorable.
Someone whose existence matters more than you realise.
</p>

<p>
On your 16th birthday, promise yourself one thing —
never stop believing in the life you want.
</p>

<p>
There will be confusing days.
There will be difficult days.
But there will also be days where everything feels right.
I hope those days always find you.
</p>

<p>
I hope you achieve every dream you've told people about
and even the ones you’ve kept to yourself.
</p>

<p>
Keep smiling the way you do.
Keep shining the way you do.
And never forget how important you are.
</p>

<p>
I’m really glad I met you, Akshara.
And I hope life gives you every happiness you deserve.
</p>

<p>
Happy Birthday once again. 🎂✨
</p>

<p>— Always wishing the best for you</p>
